title: Flanking

You gain a +2 bonus on melee hit rolls against creatures you flank[^1].

That's it.
That is the rule.
You want to know how to flank a creature?
Oh dear, we are going to be here for a while, aren't we?
Grab some graph paper.
There will be a test.

## Definition

The important part of the rule is stated up top:
you gain a +2 bonus to your melee hit rolls
as long that roll is made against a creature that you are currently _flanking_.
That bonus is non-stackable,
applies to all of your melee attacks
regardless of whether they are made with iron or flesh or aether,
and it applies independently of (and in tandem with) advantage or disadvantage.

### Flanking a creature

A creature is considered flanked when you and an ally of yours
are adjacent to it,
on opposite sides of it,
and it is _threatened_ by both you and the ally.

### Threatening a creature

Grab your weapon
or your fist
or even a spell attack or an applicable magic item
---as long as it dispenses melee attacks
and you are proficient with it.
As long as you have the weapon (or spell) ready for use,
any creature within range of it is considered threatened.

### Being on opposite sides of a creature

Take the space(s) you occupy and the space(s) occupied by your lucky friend.
Begin at the center of your own space(s)
and draw a line from that point to the center of your friend's space(s).
Look at the line you just drew:
if it passes through
two opposite edges or two opposite corners
of the space(s) occupied by a creature[^2],
then congratulations!
You and your friend are on opposite sides of the creature.

## :cloud_and_lightning: The Test :cloud_and_lightning:

This test is composed of 6 questions.
Each question is worth one point.
A satisfiable answer to the bonus question covers for a single mistake.
You can exchange your score for bragging rights.
Challenge your friends :D

1.  ![Question 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/2023/11/05/q1.svg)

    <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    <p>Yes, both are adjacent melee users who stand on opposite sides of their opponent.</p>
    </details>

2.  ![Question 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/2023/11/05/q2.svg)

    <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    <p>Yes, both are adjacent melee users who stand on opposite corners of the space occupied by their opponent.</p>
    </details>

3.  ![Question 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/2023/11/05/q3.svg)

    <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    <p>No, because Spear is not adjacent to their opponent.</p>
    </details>

4.  ![Question 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/2023/11/05/q4.svg)

    <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    <p>Yes, because both melee users are adjacent to their opponent.
    If you draw a line from one to another,
    that line goes through opposite ends of the square occupied by Orange,
    so this is absolutely a flank.</p>
    </details>

5.  ![Question 5]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/2023/11/05/q5.svg)

    <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    <p>No; Bow is in the correct position,
    but they do not have a means to make melee attacks with.
    Even if they do
    (say they have a club on their belt),
    they need to drop the bow
    and draw it before they can be considered are flanking material.</p>
    </details>

6.  ![Question 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/2023/11/05/q6.svg)

    <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    <p>No. Blue squares are in no position to flank
    given that they are not surrounding an <em>orange circle</em>.
    If you fell for it: gotcha.
    If you did not: good job!
    If you are colorblind and were unable to understand this diagram: sorry!</p>
    <p>Finally if you are feigning colorblindness to disguise that you got the question wrong,
    I would like to redirect you <a href="https://alderwood.the-comic.org/comics/68/">here</a>.</p>

[^1]: Grob smash. With friend, Grob smash better.
[^2]:
    Assume that we use squares.
    Hexagons are bestagons,
    and they deserve different treatment
    from those Square Peasants and their Non-Euclidian Philosophy.
