Strongholds & Followers is the title of a [book].
Which was written and printed under the discerning eye of a [bugbear],
which is probably the most _fun_ rulebook I read for our Most Played Version of World's Most Advertised Roleplaying Game.

Great guy (the bugbear).

Great beard.

And the rules are super evocative.

You get to Own Sizeable Property
and in the end, is that not the real fantasy?

But to the point, these rules consist of two parts.
There are two main topics covered in Ye Olde Booke.
Strongholds and (what else?) Followers!
This post has the Strongholds
and you will probably find followers during the playing of the game[^march].

## Strongholds and You

The idea of a stronghold is that it is a base,
a place where you occasionally touch base and interface with Lesser Beings
and a place you can return to and Brood if things don't go your way.

Your stronghold will be based on the ruins of the Ashen Keep,
but do not let that stop you from building something entirely different.
Who knows? You could make it into a _really large_ smith's workshop.
Just keep in mind that the terminology is here for the benefit of understanding the rules, not the fantasy.
You say Temple[^run], but your 1st-level Temple is not yet a grand edifice of marble pillars and golden statues!
...a two-room chapel is more like it.
Rome was not built in a day
and neither are cathedrals (although I _hope_ fewer sackings will be involved).
Just so for other strongholds.
A 1st-level Keep is not a functioning castle---
rather take your Ashen Keep and fill in the gaps with lumber.
Your 1st-level Tower is the top room of the watchtower but with a functioning roof and the holes filled in.
You have to upgrade your stuff to keep it competitive and get that Cathedral-Temple is what I'm saying.

### Who Builds? Who Benefits?

There is certainly enough space in and around the Bolderwood.
Unfortunately it is REALLY HARD TO FOCUS ON SPELL RESEARCH
if people are doing drills right outside your window
and your lab partner is inventing dynamite.
Thus the following rule:
only one character benefits from one stronghold facility at a time.
One Tower, one researcher.
If you want more spells researched in the same amount of time,
build another tower.

You can switch who benefits from which facility though:
the _extended rest_.
We define these as a continuous period of a week or longer spent governing and generally around your base.
As part of it,
you can switch who governs what stronghold and who reaps the rewards.

#### Strongholds & Borrowers

| Type          | Costs to Build (sp) | Upgrade to 2nd Level (sp) |
| ------------- | ------------------: | ------------------------- |
| Keep          |                1500 | 2500                      |
| Tower         |                1250 | 1500                      |
| Temple        |                1250 | 1500                      |
| Establishment |                1000 | 1000                      |

You can build multiple facilities in one building: the Castle.
You pay for each facility separately
plus a surcharge equal to 10% times the number of facilities total.
If you add another facility later, you pay the difference.
The extra costs cover the soundproof windows
that you Tower-dwellers will learn to appreciate once your Keep-er begins their daily drills.
