Strongholds & Followers is the title of a [book].
Which was written and printed under the discerning eye of a [bugbear],
and which is probably the most _fun_ rulebook I read for our Most Played Version of World's Most Advertised Roleplaying Game.
Fun compared to the other rulebooks,
which, if nothing else, are less inspiring than this one.

What can I say?
Being an Owner of Sizeable Property is just evocative fantasy, you know?

But to the point, these rules consist of two parts.
There are two main topics covered in Ye Olde Booke.
Strongholds and (what else?) Followers!
This post has the Strongholds
and you will probably find followers during the playing of the game[^march].

## Strongholds and You

The idea of a stronghold is that you get
a place to build,
a place where you govern and interface with Lesser Beings,
and a place you can return to and Brood if things don't go your way.

Your stronghold will be based in the ruins of the Ashen Keep,
but do not let that stop you from building something completely different.
Who knows?
You could make it into a _really large_ smith's workshop.
Just keep in mind that the terminology I use _here_ is different from the terminology _there_:
you might build an Establishment in the Ashen Keep,
but remains an Establishment, not a Keep.
And on that note:
you say Temple[^run],
but that 1st-level Temple is not a grand edifice of marble pillars and golden statues!
"Two-room chapel" is probably closer to the truth.
Rome was not built in a day
and neither are cathedrals (although I _hope_ fewer sackings will be involved).
It is just so for other strongholds.
A 1st-level Keep is not a functioning castle---
take your Ashen Keep, fill in the gaps with lumber, add a palisade, and that is what you get.
Your 1st-level Tower is built on top of the watchtower
but most of the money goes to a functioning roof, blastproof lining, and filling in the missing bricks.
You have to buy upgrades and boost the economy if you want that Cathedral-Temple.

### Who Builds? Who Benefits?

There is space in and around the Bolderwood for a stronghold or three.
Unfortunately it is **really hard to focus on spell research**
if troops are doing drills right outside your window
AND your lab partner is testing their "dynamite" invention.
Thus the following rule:
only one character benefits from one stronghold facility at a time.
One Tower, one researcher.
If you want more spells researched in the same amount of time,
build a second tower.

You can switch who benefits from which facility though when you take an _extended rest_.
We define these as a continuous period of a week or longer spent governing
and generally hanging around your base.
The extended rest will be used to recharge some abilities as well,
so keep it in mind.

#### Strongholds & Costs

| Type          |   Build |     Lv2 |
| ------------- | ------: | ------: |
| Keep          | 1500 sp | 2500 sp |
| Tower         | 1250 sp | 1500 sp |
| Temple        | 1250 sp | 1500 sp |
| Establishment | 1000 sp | 1000 sp |

You can build multiple facilities in one building: the Castle.
You pay for each facility separately
plus a surcharge equal to 10% times the number of facilities total.
If you add another facility later, you pay the difference.
The extra costs cover the soundproof windows
that you Tower-dwellers will learn to appreciate once your keeper begins their daily drills.

> The Tower costs 1.3 &times; (1,250 (tower) + 3,300 (TempleKeep) &divide; 1.2) - 3,300 (TempleKeep) = 1,900 silver pieces.
