Strongholds & Followers is the title of a [book].
Which was written and printed under the discerning eye of a [bugbear],
and which is probably the most _fun_ rulebook I read for our Most Played Version of World's Most Advertised Roleplaying Game.

He has some pretty neat DM-ing shtick on his channel.

And the rules are super evocative.

You get to be an Owner of Sizeable Property
and is that not the real fantasy?

But to the point, these rules consist of two parts.
There are two main topics covered in Ye Olde Booke.
Strongholds and (what else?) Followers!
This post has the Strongholds
and you will probably find followers during the playing of the game[^march].

## Strongholds and You

The idea of a stronghold is that it is a base,
a place where you occasionally touch base and interface with Lesser Beings
and a place you can return to and Brood if things don't go your way.

Your stronghold will be based in the ruins of the Ashen Keep,
but do not let that stop you from building something different than a keep.
Who knows? You could make it into a _really large_ smith's workshop.
Just keep in mind that the terminology is here for the benefit of understanding the rules, not the fantasy.
You say Temple[^run], but your 1st-level Temple is not yet a grand edifice of marble pillars and golden statues!
Two-room chapel is more like it.
Rome was not built in a day
and neither are cathedrals (although I _hope_ fewer sackings will be involved).
It is just so for other strongholds.
A 1st-level Keep is not a functioning castle---
take your Ashen Keep, fill in the gaps with lumber, add a palisade, and that is what you get.
Your 1st-level Tower is built on top of the watchtower
but most of the money goes to a functioning roof, blast lining, and filling in the missing bricks.
You have to upgrade your stuff to keep it competitive and get that Cathedral-Temple is what I'm saying.

### Who Builds? Who Benefits?

There is space in and around the Bolderwood for a stronghold or three.
Unfortunately it is _really hard to focus on spell research_
if troops are doing drills right outside your window
AND your lab partner is inventing dynamite.
Thus the following rule:
only one character benefits from one stronghold facility at a time.
One Tower, one researcher.
If you want more spells researched in the same amount of time,
build another tower.

You can switch who benefits from which facility though:
the _extended rest_.
We define these as a continuous period of a week or longer spent governing and generally around your base.
As part of it,
you can switch who governs what stronghold and who reaps the rewards.

#### Keeps & Cost

| Type          |   Build |     Lv2 |
| ------------- | ------: | ------: |
| Keep          | 1500 sp | 2500 sp |
| Tower         | 1250 sp | 1500 sp |
| Temple        | 1250 sp | 1500 sp |
| Establishment | 1000 sp | 1000 sp |

You can build multiple facilities in one building: the Castle.
You pay for each facility separately
plus a surcharge equal to 10% times the number of facilities total.
If you add another facility later, you pay the difference.
The extra costs cover the soundproof windows
that you Tower-dwellers will learn to appreciate once your Keep-er begins their daily drills.

> They polls the local carpenter's guild who send an invoice back

> Once Dridugar's Fancy TempleKeep is built
> their friend Fiogo senses a chance of chicanery and orders a Tower for cheap.
> The cunning and handsome GM however sees through Fiogo's foibles.
> The Tower costs 1.3 &times; (1,250 (tower) + 3,300 (TempleKeep) &divide; 1.2) - 3,300 (TempleKeep) = 1,900 silver pieces.
