title: Compact Custom Character Copy

So I made a personal character sheet for each of y'all.
Here are the files associated with that project.

Just a precaution though.
I like to think I have a tidy computer and that I keep track of my files.
Yet I make _no guarantees whatsoever_ that I still have these files, or even that they are available on this page.
Who knows? GitHub (the host of this sit) could decide to delete them from their servers tomorrow.
If you want guaranteed access to these files for the rest of time, I see but one solution:

**Download them, put them somewhere you'll remember, and make backups.**

With that out of the way, here's the files.

## Frequently Asked Questions

My target audience has rarely, if ever, asked these questions, but I do not question the terminology.

### Why two files?

Because they were optimized for different use-cases.
The print version has much higher resolution and a bunch of PDF settings for better printing.
The digital version, in comparison, is a lot smaller and lightweight.
Your iPads and laptops will thank me.

### What about form-fillable PDFs?

I have looked into it!
Unfortunately, though there are free tools to do it on the internet, they are not exactly easy to find---or use.
One of the reasons I began this project is to get folks to not hide behind giant laptops, so I decided not to go through with it.
Feel free to add support for forms yourself though.

### There are some slight differences between the paper sheet I got and the PDF?

When I began this project, I sort-of made the style up as I went along.
As I encountered new challenges I had to adjust that style a bit.
Now that everything is squared away I did a final pass make everything nice and (somewhat) uniform.
The content of your sheet should not have changed, but if it does, see the next question.

### Can you change \_\_\_

Reticent yes.

I've spent _a lot_ of time on these already.
I enjoyed it, and I did it voluntarily, don't get me wrong---but I owe myself a break.
An unfortunate side effect of fancy customizable layout programs is that they can be _incredibly_ fiddly and time-consuming to work with.
So, for example, if you want to:

- Fix a typo: adjust the text, then fix any layout errors that occur.
  For example, if you replace an `n` by an `m` (which is bigger), you might wrap a line that should not wrap.
  Now you have to shave off that space somewhere else on the line!
  Still, that is an unlikely case.
  Expect about 3 minutes of work.
- Change a phrase: like changing a type, but layout shenanigans are guaranteed.
  30 minutes of work.
- Reorder table columns: you'd think this is built-in, but I actually adjusted all tables by hand.
  If you swap two columns (a simple cut-and-paste), you have to redo all of that.
  30 minutes of work.
- Add an extra column here, or make _this bit_ wider: now that part is bigger and it is on top of another thing.
  So I have to find a spot for that, but now it is on top of _something else_.
  3 hours of work, minimum.

That said, if you find a mistake, I will fix it.
But I am not making changes just for ~aesthetics~.
If that's what you want, I'll send you the source file with instructions to make your own changes.

### How to print?

With your favorite <s>demon from the darkest pits of hell</s> printer.
Each page is A5, half of an A4, but your printer probably has some margins it won't touch.
It is safest to print one page per A4.

I print my sheets on 300-grams paper rather than the usual stuff: if your printer can handle it, I'd recommend it.
It's a lot more resistant to wear-and-tear than the usual stuff.
