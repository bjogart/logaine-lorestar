The following are excerpts of a codex unearthed from the archives of Task,
written by one Atkin Silasson,
donated by a collector of sorts who wished to remain private.

### On the Council's Formation and Troops

...in the early days of the Council of Ash,
it was understood that its members were adventurers
whose investiture happened out of political necessity.
Without birthright or township,
their early days were indeed lacking in manpower,
although the contents of an early ledger show
a smattering of troops was pulled in haste from most every direction.

First there was Cerdic's Company;
a group of guardsmen of Gwydion led by noble Cerdic.
It is understood that this Cerdic persuaded the higher-ups in Marcester to send this aid,
out of duty,
but also his rapport with Councilor Fridugar.

Then there was Aian's Terminus,
a group of horsemen cobbled together from men and women of the Southern Garrison.
As the Garrison lay empty,
due to the trouble with the rocs at the Aian Cliffs,
their spokesman, Roy,
son of a Hylloch farrier,
pulled strings and formed a small unit of cavalry.
With the blessing of Brungar,
about half of the garrison's men joined the Council to prepare
for the days of turmoil they expected in the future.

Third were the Bloody Bolts,
a different group of adventurers and part-time mercenaries.
Smelling an opportunity,
one of their members, Jessica,
approached the Council in hopes of stable employment
with due benefits of health insurance and sickness leave.

The story of the final unit is an odd one;
they were elves from Kajuron,
Ensojil ("censors") sent to deal with the naga that ran amuck in Marcester.
Under the command of Tajan they set out to do just that,
but due to temporal disturbances they were displaced into the future
after the Council had settled the issue already.
No way home,
Tajan was impressed by the Council's frank manner
and they and their Ensojil agreed to remain at the Ashen Keep for some time.
It was this decision that led to...

### On the Tests of the Mentor

...early days show a tenuous relationship between the Council and their neighbors.
Councilor Fridugar did appear to retain good relationships with the standing army at this time however,
especially with his mentor Wulfstan,
who was still alive and healthy a good 3 months after tutoring the Councilor.

In fact, it appears that they had a meeting of sorts while the Ashen Keep was under construction.
During this meeting Wulfstan appears to have made a personal request of Fridugar,
to acquire a certain volume.
During this time it appears that a closely guarded copy of the tome was available in Task,
though the Chained Knights were under...

### On the Call of the Vanguard

...it was likely this enigma that led Lord Felim Wynne to invoke his right to form the Vanguard.
He embarked on a tour through Logand to spread his vision.
As ever is it simple enough to track the movements of the Duke
given successive sightings of his unusually tall stature and apparently magnificent mustache.
Though historic circles dispute that Duke Wynne's mustache sheen was enough to light up even a pitch-black room,
it is generally agreed upon that he traveled through the entire country,
from Enstrath to Marcester,
and that he met with many Houses to explain the disappearance of Parrif citizens,
the slowness of the military apparatus,
and the need to Call the Vanguard.
Initial response was...

### On Artificial Unintelligence in Northern Logand

...by this point Grosvenor Kannard III had shown off his Dragon Knight Golems
to at least such a degree it became somewhat common belief he had resurrected the Dragon Knights.
Fewer people knew that these were golems, automatons, creatures of magic and steel.

His enemies appear to have had some interest in Kannard's creations however,
as some inquiries were made by Fridugar of the Council of Ash on the nature and origin of one automaton.
This claim is disputed however,
as some believe that Councilor Fridugar was researching the guardian of a tomb in his native Bolderwood.
Nowadays such a creature is rather considered Stoneborn instead,
as the magic required to animate a creature of the size and prowess
would have been near intractable...

### On the Ancestry of a Councilor

...storied past is that of Councilor Eilanore.
From a letter by burgomaster Liliane Ormond of Milbridge,
we can glean that the Councilor visited her hometown during this period.
Though Eilanore was considered extremely young when she took up her duties
to Marcester and its people,
to the Kingdom and its throne,
and to her nebulous patron,
in this latter at least she appears to have had counsel of her own:
her own grandmother Aenor.

Aenor appears to be a nebulous person in her own right.
Milbridge-born, she vanished soon after the birth of her daughter Elvira.
She did not return until decades later,
appearing just as suddenly on the doorstep of her daughter's burgeoning family,
with no apparent recollection of the intervening decades.
According to a brief conversation,
Eilanore's awakening to her powers stirred something in her memory,
and she began actively seeking out others who knew...

### On a Man of Many Talents

...the wizard Archibald's movements are difficult to track
both due to his remarkable reclusiveness
as well as his complicated movements through time.
What is clear however,
is that the wizard Morcant was keen on tracking down his mentor.
A scrap notes a Sending between Councilor Fridugar and the Archibald here.
Fridugar inquires as to Archibald's progress,
the response to which is noted in remarkable detail:

> Progress is slow.
> Violent creatures dwell here.
> Progress is slow: aid is welcome.
> Minor discoveries,
> though I have reason to believe the motherlode lies deeper.

### On Birds and the Government

...the town was deeply affected by the migration of rocs from caves in the Aian Cliffs.
Multiple eyewitness reports are available
from townsfolk,
correspondence of guardsmen with Saint Gwydion's Temple,
and last but not least an in-depth description of Councilor Diogo's journey to Avon-at-Eire.

According to members of the Southern Garrison rocs were not an uncommon sight in the area,
and they used caves in the chalk cliffs to nest.
They were rarely found inland
as they derived their sustenance from the sea.
Lately however this changed,
and the birds left these caves and began attacking townsfolk and travelers.
The local garrison rallied as a result,
and the townsfolk evacuated to Milbridge.
The wizard Hamish and miners from Cairning to aid the research.

There also appears to be an influx of treasure hunters,
who clambered in an out of nesting caves to obtain the valuable roc down that was found inside.
This practice does not appear to be without danger,
however, as hunting parties regularly lost members to cave-ins.

Along with cave-ins,
the frequency of local earthquakes increased dramatically,
detected from as far away as Milbridge.
These quakes were accompanied by rough seas
and the occasional report of screams or roars emanating from the cliff-side caves.
As the frequency of this phenomenon increased,
it appears the number of hunting parties sharply dropped.
This is theorized to be a result of casualties due to cliff instability.

The Councilor Diogo is first to note another occasional phenomenon:
beached fish-like creatures on the Aian Cliffs.
Though called fish,
these creatures were apparently humongous,
reaching up to twenty meters and with smooth skin, not scales.
Every specimen found was presumably killed in the same manner:
a puncture wound or gash,
largely on the front or top of the head.
Other areas of the fish appeared untouched
although there is speculation...

### On the Flouting of Personal Space

...in those early days the work on the Ashen Keep was slow
and sometimes interrupted by an unwashed figure from the woods
who harassed the craftsmen.
It was not until Councilor Diogo stepped in that the figure revealed itself.
Calling himself "Keegan",
the figure claimed to be a member of an elusive group named "Orion's Belt".
After harassing the Councilor's trusted confidant Monk-E,
turning into a humongous dog,
and claiming the Councilor smelt of neural toxins,
this Keegan declared that Diogo was "not the master",
but that he "would do".
It is understood that this Keegan stayed outside the keep,
but hence reports of workplace harassment ceased.

### On How the Decapod Crustaceans Interfaced Beyond Themselves

...her visit to Milbridge,
it appears the Councilor visited the isle situated near the town.
Commonly known as "Crab Isle",
no doubt due to its pincer-like lagoon,
the isle was a common playground for children
who fished for the eponymous animals.

The Councilor Eilanore reported an extensive cave network underneath the island.
It appears that the marchioness' men were aware of these caves,
although they were never found by officials.
The Councilor further found oddities around these caves,
such as off-color walls harboring veins of an unspecified material,
and oily slicks under and around the island.
Though local smugglers understood quicksilver was a valuable tool against temporal disturbances,
these occurrences are no doubt...
