The following are excerpts of a history book unearthed from the archives of Task,
written by a hack historian
and donated by a collector of coffee table books.

### On the Council's Formation and Troops

...in the early days of the Council of Ash,
it was understood that its members were adventurers
whose investment happened out of political necessity.
Without birthright or township,
their early days were indeed lacking in manpower,
although the contents of an early ledger show
a smattering of troops was pulled in haste from most every direction.

First there was Cerdic's Company;
a group of guardsmen of Gwydion led by noble Cerdic.
It is understood that this Cerdic persuaded the higher-ups in Marcester to send this aid,
out of duty
and also out of rapport with Councilor Fridugar.

Then there was Aian's Terminus,
a group of horsemen cobbled together from men and women of the Southern Garrison.
As the Garrison lay empty,
due to trouble with rocs at the Aian Cliffs,
their spokesman, Roy,
son of a Hylloch farrier,
pulled strings and formed a small unit of cavalry.
With the blessing of Brungar,
about half of the garrison's men joined the Council to prepare
for days of turmoil they expected in the future.

Third were the Bloody Bolts,
a different group of adventurers;
part-time mercenaries, too.
Smelling an opportunity,
one member, Jessica,
approached the Council
in the hope of securing of stable employment
with due benefits of health insurance and sickness leave.

The story of the final unit is an odd one;
they were elves from Kajuron,
Ensojil ("censors") sent to deal with the naga that ran amuck in Marcester.
Under the command of Tajan they set out to do just that,
but due to temporal disturbances they were displaced into the future
after the Council had settled the issue already.
No way home,
Tajan was impressed by the Council's frank manner
and they and their Ensojil agreed to remain at the Ashen Keep for some time.
It was this decision that led to...

### On the Testing of the Mentor

...early days show a tenuous relationship between the Council and their neighbors.
Councilor Fridugar did retain good relationships with the standing army at this time however,
especially with his mentor Wulfstan,
who was still alive and healthy a good 3 months after the termination of tutoring this trainee.

In fact, it appears that they had a meeting of sorts while the Ashen Keep was under construction.
During this meeting Wulfstan appears to have made a personal request of Fridugar,
to acquire a certain volume.
It appears that a closely guarded copy of the tome was available in Task,
though the Chained Knights were under...

### On the Call of the Vanguard

...it was likely this enigma that led Lord Felim Wynne to invoke his right to form the Vanguard.
He embarked on a tour through Logand to spread his vision.
As ever is it simple enough to track the movements of the Duke
given successive sightings of his unusually tall stature and apparently magnificent mustache.
Historic circles dispute that Duke Wynne's mustache sheen was enough to light up a pitch-black room,
but it is generally agreed upon that he traveled the breadth of Logand,
from Enstrath to Marcester,
and that he met with many Houses to explain the plight of Parrif citizens,
the responsiveness of the military apparatus,
and the need to Call the Vanguard.
Initial response was...

### On Artificial Unintelligence in Northern Logand

...by this point Grosvenor Kannard III had shown off his Dragon Knight Golems
to at least such a degree it became somewhat common belief he had resurrected the Dragon Knights.
Fewer people knew that these were golems, automatons, creatures of magic and steel.

His enemies appear to have had some interest in Kannard's creations however,
as some inquiries were made by Fridugar of the Council of Ash on the nature and origin of one automaton.
This claim is disputed however,
as some believe that Councilor Fridugar rather researched a tomb guardian in his native Bolderwood.
Nowadays such a creature is rather considered Stoneborn,
as the magic required to animate a creature of that size and prowess...

### On the Ancestry of a Councilor

...storied past is that of Councilor Eilanore.
From a letter by burgomaster Liliane Ormond of Milbridge,
we glean that the Councilor visited her hometown in this period.
Though Eilanore was considered young when she took up duties,
to Marcester and its people,
to the Kingdom and its throne,
and to her nebulous patron,
in this latter at least she appears to have had counsel:
her grandmother Aenor.

Aenor was a nebulous person in her own right.
Milbridge-born, she vanished soon after the birth of her daughter Elvira.
She would not return for decades,
appearing with equal abruptness on the doorstep of her daughter's burgeoning family,
with no recollection of the intervening time.
A brief conversation seems to have occurred,
Eilanore's awakening to her powers stirred something in Aenor's memory,
and she began actively seeking out others who...

### On a Man of Many Talents

...the wizard Archibald's movements are difficult to track
both due to his remarkable reclusiveness
as well as his complicated movements through time.
What is clear however,
is that the wizard Morcant was keen on tracking down his mentor.
A scrap of notebook details a Sending between Councilor Fridugar and Archibald.
Fridugar inquires as to Archibald's progress,
the response to which is noted:

> Progress is slow.
> Violent creatures dwell here.
> Progress is slow: aid is welcome.
> Minor discoveries,
> though I have reason to believe the motherlode lies deeper.

### On Birds and the Government

...the town was deeply affected by the migration of rocs from caves in the Aian Cliffs.
Reports are available from townsfolk who witnessed the event,
correspondence of guardsmen with Saint Gwydion's Temple,
and last but not least an in-depth description of Councilor Diogo's journey to Avon-at-Eire.

According to members of the Southern Garrison,
rocs were not an uncommon sight in the area,
and they nested in caves in the chalk cliffs.
They were rarely found inland
as they derived sustenance from the sea.
Lately however this changed,
and the birds left their caves,
attacking townsfolk and travelers.
The local garrison rallied,
and the townsfolk evacuated to Milbridge.
The wizard Hamish,
and with miners from Cairning,
were called to set up countermeasures.

There also appears to be an influx of hunters to Avon,
who clambered in an out of nesting caves to obtain the valuable roc down found inside.
This practice does not appear to be without danger,
as hunting parties regularly lost members to cave-ins.

The frequency of local earthquakes increased dramatically, too,
and the were detected from as distant as Milbridge.
These quakes were accompanied by rough seas
and the occasional report of screams or roars emanating from the cliff-side caves.
As the frequency of these phenomena increased,
the number of hunting parties sharply dropped.
This is theorized to be a result of casualties due to cliff instability.

A courier's message from Brungar from this time describes
that the miners returned to Cairning quickly.
They were initially requested to clear caves and open paths,
but their work increased the frequency of rumblings,
as if the cliffs themselves were agitated.

The Councilor Diogo is first to note another phenomenon:
the occasional beached fish-like creature on the Aian Cliffs.
Though called fish,
these creatures reached up to twenty meters
and they had smooth skin, not scales.
Every specimen found carried a wound of the same kind:
a puncture wound or gash,
always on the front or top of the head.
Other areas seemed pristine
though speculation abounds...

### On the Flouting of Personal Space

...days work on the Ashen Keep was slow
and interrupted by an unwashed figure from the woods
that harassed the craftsmen.
It was not until Councilor Diogo stepped in that the figure truly revealed itself.
Calling himself "Keegan",
the figure claimed to be a member of an elusive group named "Orion's Belt".
After harassing the Councilor's trusted confidant Monk-E,
turning himself into a humongous dog,
and claiming the Councilor smelt of neural toxins,
this "Keegan" declared that Diogo was "not the master",
but that he "would suffice".
It is understood that this Keegan took up vigil near the keep,
but hence reports of workplace harassment...

### On How the Decapod Crustaceans Interfaced Beyond Themselves

...visit to Milbridge,
it appears the Councilor visited the isle situated near the town.
Commonly known as "Crab Isle",
no doubt due to its pincer-like lagoon,
the isle was a common playground for children
who fished for the eponymous animals.

The Councilor Eilanore reported an extensive cave network underneath the island.
It appears that the marchioness' men were dimly aware of these caves,
although no official records of these caves could be found.
The Councilor further found oddities near the caves,
such as off-color walls harboring veins of an unspecified nature,
and oily slicks underneath and around the island.
Around this time it became a policy of the Temple...
