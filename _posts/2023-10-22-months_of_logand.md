title: Months of Logand

---

Logand uses its own calendar with days, weeks, and months.
This calendar is not universally adopted throughout the world
but a derivative calendar finds use among sailors and navigators
because it synchronizes well with certain natural events.

Each year counts 364 days.
These days are neatly split up into 13 months of 28 days each.
After one year ends,
but before the next year begins,
lies Frihddwn:
a day of retrospection which is its own thing.
It does not belong to either year.

Put Frihddwn with the year before it
and the full calendar counts 365 days.
(How convenient!)

## Lunar Origins of the Calendar

The people of Logand understand that their calendar is based on lunar cycles:
every month the moon is in the same position in the sky for a given day.
Frihddwn came about as a cultural phenomenon.
The moon, as it happens, is not a cultural phenomenon,
and because of it the moon phase shifts by one day between years.
