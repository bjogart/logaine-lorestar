title: Flanking
tags: homebrew houserules

The idea of flanking is as old as time and quite simple indeed[^1]:
if a guy is busy dodging something else then they must be easier to hit.
Quite a few games simulate something similar through facing:
you decide which direction your units look
and they take less damage from the front and more from the back or something similar.
In D&D, which has no facing, it gets a little more difficult
because you have to convince your GM that
"No, this dude must be looking somewhere else, really, there's totally a bear there".
Logand does not have bears though
so forthwith another way for you to gang up on some poor schmuck.

And go find some graph paper.
There will be a test.

## Benefits of Flanking

You gain a +2 bonus to your melee hit rolls
as long that roll is made against a creature that you are currently _flanking_.

The bonus from flanking applies to all of your melee attacks
regardless of whether they are made with iron or flesh or mana,
and it applies independently of (and in tandem with) advantage or disadvantage.

### How to Flank a Creature

A creature is considered flanked when you and an ally of yours
are adjacent to it,
on opposite sides of it,
and it is _threatened_ by both you and the ally.

### How to Threaten a Creature

Grab your weapon
or your fist
or even a spell attack or an applicable magic item
---as long as it dispenses melee attacks
and you are proficient with it.
As long as you have the weapon (or spell) ready for use,
any creature within range of it is considered threatened.

### Positioning on Opposite Sides of a Creature

Take the space(s) you occupy and the space(s) occupied by your lucky friend.
Begin at the center of your own space(s)
and draw a line from that point to the center of your friend's space(s).
Look at the line you just drew:
if it passes through
two opposite edges or two opposite corners
of the space(s) occupied by a creature[^2],
then congratulations!
You and your friend are on opposite sides of the creature.

## üå©Ô∏è The Test üå©Ô∏è

This test is composed of 6 questions.
Each question is worth one point.
A satisfiable answer to the bonus question covers for a single mistake.
You can exchange your score for bragging rights.
Challenge your friends :D

For each diagram below,

### Question 1

![Question 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource/post/2023-10-29-flanking-q1.svg)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>Yes, both are adjacent melee users who stand on opposite sides of their opponent.</p>
</details>

### Question 2

![Question 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource/post/2023-10-29-flanking-q2.svg)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>Yes, both are adjacent melee users who stand on opposite corners of the space occupied by their opponent.</p>
</details>

### Question 3

![Question 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource/post/2023-10-29-flanking-q3.svg)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>No, because Spear is not adjacent to their opponent.</p>
</details>

### Question 4

![Question 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource/post/2023-10-29-flanking-q4.svg)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>Yes, because both melee users are adjacent to their opponent.
If you draw a line from one to another,
that line goes through opposite ends of the squares occupied by Orange,
so this is absolutely a flank.</p>
</details>

### Question 5

![Question 5]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource/post/2023-10-29-flanking-q5.svg)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>No; Bow is in the correct position,
but they are not capable of making melee attacks
and do not threaten Orange.
Even if they can make melee attacks
(say they have a club on their belt),
they need to drop the bow
and draw it before they can be considered flanking material.</p>
</details>

### Question 6

![Question 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/resource/post/2023-10-29-flanking-q6.svg)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>No. Blue squares are in no position to flank
given that they are not surrounding an <em>orange circle</em>.
