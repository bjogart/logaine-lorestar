The point of a Keep is that it is defensible and sturdy.
It tells people "someone is here, they are comfy, and they are not leaving".

This will not stop everybody.
But for those who remain undeterred,
you have an army!

When you built your Keep,
you scrounged up a smattering of troops,
and you can spend money to advertise and recruit more.
You also spend money to get your troops better equipment and training.

Troops protect your stronghold,
and we assume you spend some of your "free" time to train them.
Your army is your army:
they follow your orders.
Order them to clear an area of nasties,
or conquer the lands of that annoying neighbor.
They are soldiers, though, not adventurers!
In their contract is says they do not have to delve into a dungeon if they do not consent,
nor do they have to solve ethical quandaries,
or buy 40 sets of rations,
or perform barely legal actions,
like adventurers like yourselves tend to do.

## Stronghold BookKeeping

Building and maintaining a castle and an army takes time and money;
but, that said, I'd rather Keep my campaign spreadsheet-free.

Assume the people that live around your stronghold pay taxes,
or provide labor that help maintain your facilities.
(That also means you should not levy more to line your pockets!
Good chance they move out if you do.)
Your troops,
when they are not in active service,
earn their Keep by doing other tasks your burgeoning community needs them to do:
standing guard,
looking important,
or Keeping the area free of nasty monsters.
All this earns you exactly enough money to maintain your Keep,
and enough to pay a modest salary of your army units.
(Enough to Keep them from instigating a revolt against your rule.)

### Keep Level

Upgrading your Keep means that it is harder to destroy in a siege,
but more importantly,
bigger Keeps house more troops.

A Keep can house units equal to 4 &times; its level.

#### Keep levels

| Level | Cost (sp) | #Units |
| ----: | --------: | -----: |
|     1 |      1500 |      4 |
|     2 |      2500 |      8 |
|     3 |      3750 |     12 |
|     4 |      5000 |     16 |
|     5 |      6250 |     20 |

Upgrading your Keep is something you can do during an _extended rest_
(see [Intro to Strongholds]({% post_url 2023-11-05-intro-to-strongholds %})).

You pay the required amount,
and your architects and artisans will do the rest.
Building takes time,
the amount depends on your Keep's level and the situation.

### Recruitment

You can advertise to recruit units:
tell your GM what you are looking for,
and your GM gets back to you with applicants.
Choose one or more,
pay their cost,
and now they are one of your units!
You are provided with a fancy-looking unit card
and you are free to order your new troop around
however you see fit.

### UpKeep

Every soldier in your service earns their own salary.
You need not pay them extra,
though I am sure they would appreciate it!
You _do_ pay for equipment repair
and training costs,
which amounts to 10% of a unit's initial cost every month.

I will notify you
when a month begins in-game,
At that time you pay the total for all your units.
If you are unable to afford ,
you will be requested to please disband units until you
until you can afford to pay the upKeep of your remaining units.

### Bettering Your Units

Having these fun unit cards is fine and dandy,
but there is a good chance you will one day force them to fight a war on your behalf,
and---assuming you are playing for Keeps---
it is wise to upgrade your troops,
which is another thing you can do during an extended rest.

When you look at a unit card,
there should be a line like
_regular human light infantry_.

That last one, _infantry_,
is the unit's type.
It cannot be upgraded or sidegraded.

The second one, _human_,
notes what species your soldiers belong to.
I tried to Google _"upgrade species"_
---this one is off-limits.

That leaves two keywords:

- **Regular** notes how experienced your troops are.
  Experienced troops have better
  Attack, Defense, Morale, Command,
  and _very_ experienced units can even make more attacks in a single turn.

  Experience, here, does mean the kind you get from real situation.
  Training drills will not improve it; only battles will.
  A unit must survive a certain number of battles
  before they qualify for that improved experience moniker.
  Once they are qualified,
  you can choose to upgrade experience to the next level during your next extended rest,
  or you can choose to Keep them at their current level.

- **Light** is the equipment your units are carrying.
  We don't do _light infantry_ versus _heavy infantry_ here;
  at least not based on this keyword.
  Heavy equipment is higher quality stuff than light equipment;

  To upgrade Attack and Defense you might need the vague currency of "life experience",
  but if you have the money
  you can freely upgrade your units' equipment as long as you can afford to
  though you are limited to one upgrade per unit per extended rest.

Whenever your units,
their stats and their value increase,
meaning their upKeep will increase as well.
A unit's tier never improves;
it is more of an indication how exclusive a unit is compared to their peers.
