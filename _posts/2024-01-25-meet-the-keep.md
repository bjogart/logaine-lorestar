The point of a Keep is that it is defensible and sturdy.
It tells people "Someone is here, they are comfy, and they are not leaving".

This will not stop everybody.
But for those who remain undeterred,
you have an army!

When you built your Keep,
you scrounged up a smattering of troops,
and you can spend money to advertise and recruit more.
You also spend money to get your troops better equipment and training.
Troops protect your stronghold
unless you order them to perform some other task.

Your army is your _army_:
they follow your orders.
Order them to clear an area of nasties
or conquer the lands of that annoying neighbor.
They are soldiers, though, not adventurers!
In their contract it says they do not have to delve into a dungeon without consent,
and neither do they have to solve ethical quandaries,
or perform barely legal actions,
like adventurers.

## Stronghold BookKeeping

Assume the people that live around your stronghold pay taxes
or provide labor that help maintain your facilities.
(That also means you should not levy more!)
When your troops are not in active service,
they earn their Keep by performing other tasks your community needs them to do:
standing guard or Keeping the area free of nasty monsters.
The revenue gained this way is enough for your troops to earn their Keep
and maintain your Keep at its current level.

If you want to improve your Keep, though, read on.

### Keep Level

Upgrading your Keep means that it is harder to destroy in a siege,
but more importantly,
bigger Keeps house more troops.

A Keep can house units equal to 4 &times; its level.

#### Keep levels

| Level | Cost (sp) | #Units |
| ----: | --------: | -----: |
|     1 |      1500 |      4 |
|     2 |      2500 |      8 |
|     3 |      3750 |     12 |
|     4 |      5000 |     16 |
|     5 |      6250 |     20 |

Upgrading your Keep is something you can do during an _extended rest_
(see [Intro to Strongholds]({% post_url 2023-11-05-intro-to-strongholds %})).

You pay the required amount,
and your architects and artisans will do the rest.
Building takes  some time,
the exact amount depends the situation.

### Recruitment

You can advertise to recruit units:
figure out what units you are looking for.
Units who feel they fit the bill will arrive at your Keep
and you decide whether they fit the bill.

Once you are happy enough to hire a unit,
pay them their full cost
and now they are one of your units!
Order your new troop around however you see fit.

### UpKeep

Every soldier in your service earns their own salary.
You need not pay them extra,
though they they would surely appreciate it!
You _do_ pay for equipment repair
and training costs,
which amounts to 10% of a unit's initial cost every month.

> For example, say you have units worth 440sp, 573sp, 500sp, and 595sp.
> Their total value is 440 + 573 + 500 + 595 = 2108.
> 10% of 2108 is 210.8sp.

We do this bookkeeping whenever you take an extended rest the first time each month.
If you are unable to afford to pay for a unit
then they go Bust:
they have disadvantage on all checks.
This unit will stay Busted until you make up the difference.
If you fail to pay a Busted unit again,
they will disband.

### Bettering Your Units

There is a good chance you will one day need your units to fight a war on your behalf
and---if you play for Keeps---
it would be wise to upgrade your troops.
This is another thing you can do during an extended rest.

When you look at a unit card,
there should be a line like
_regular human light infantry_.

That last one, _infantry_,
is the unit's type.
It cannot be upgraded or sidegraded.

The second one, _human_,
is an indication of the species to which soldiers in the unit belong.
To be certain I Googled _"upgrade\ species"_
---this one is off-limits.

That leaves two keywords:

- **Regular** notes how experienced your troops are.
  Experienced troops have better
  Attack, Defense, Morale, Command,
  and _very_ experienced units can even make more attacks in a single turn.

  Experience means the kind you get from real situations.
  Training drills will not improve it;
  only battles do.
  A unit must survive a certain number of battles
  before they qualify for that improved experience moniker.
  Once they are qualified,
  you can choose to upgrade experience to the next level during your next extended rest,
  or you can choose to Keep them at their current level.

- **Light** is the equipment your units are carrying.
  We don't do _light cavalry_ versus _heavy cavalry_.
  Heavy equipment is higher quality stuff than light equipment;
  if you want mobile scout troops,
  there are unit traits for that.

  To upgrade Attack and Defense you might need the vague currency of "life\ experience",
  but if you have the money,
  You can freely upgrade your units' equipment if you can afford it.
  Though a unit is limited to one equipment upgrade per extended rest.

Whenever your units improve,
their stats (and their value) increase,
so their upKeep increases a little bit as well.

#### Experience

| Experience  | #Battles |
| ----------- | -------: |
| green       |        1 |
| regular     |        1 |
| veteran     |        3 |
| elite       |        4 |
| super-elite |      --- |

#### Equipment

| Equipment   |         Cost (sp) |
| ----------- | ----------------: |
| light       |  250 &times; tier |
| medium      |  500 &times; tier |
| heavy       | 1000 &times; tier |
| super-heavy |               --- |
