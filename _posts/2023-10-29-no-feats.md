title: Not wanted: Feats

In the Good Old Days,
when fighters could only make one attack
and all wizards had names like Xagyg (reverse that name),
there was no such thing as a "feat".
And we liked it!

The things-that-would-become-feats were introduced in full in the Big Crunchy Revamped Edition.
That's a long time ago, but feats were different back then.
Reading through the rulebook,
feats are much more like we think of class abilities.
Rather than a list of abilities like:

Level 1. Power Attack.
: When you attack,
you can take a hit penalty equal to your proficiency
and gain a damage bonus equal to twice your proficiency.

Level 2. Action Surge
: Once per rest, you can take a second action on your turn.

Level 3. Power Shove
: When you make a Power Attack and hit,
you can give up the damage bonus to push the target 5'.

Level 4. Action---Reaction
: When you use your Action Surge,
a creature of your choice within 30' refreshes their reaction.

You got a giant book of feats
and a class description that boiled down to
"choose a feat every X levels".

My understanding is that these feats are smaller
and some compound together
like a skill tree:

Action Surge (level 2 and up)
: Once per rest, you can take a second action on your turn.

Call to Action (requires Action Surge)
: When you use your Action Surge,
you may take the Speech action once as a free action
on top of the action afforded by your Action Surge.

Action---Reaction (requires Action Surge, and level 5 fighter)
: When you use your Action Surge,
a creature of your choice within 30' refreshes their reaction.

All together, this means that knowing someone plays a fighter
actually says remarkably little about what they _do_:
you'd need to know how their fighter was built to know that.

Now given the title of the post
and the occasional past rant of mine,
you are probably expecting me to explain
that my hate for feats is intense enough to burn a hole in the sun,
but you know what?
I actually love these kinds of systems.

It is concise,
allows players to build their character close to how they imagine
and there is plenty of room for development at the table left.
For example, the people of Marcester were eye-witnesses to one of the greater sieges of the last century.
They might get access to an unique Siege Defender trait that grants additional bonuses when they equip a shield.
Or imagine a unique feat available to wielders of magical items that give greater proficiency or additional moves.

The system is not without issues though.
For example, each new setting book included its own list of curated feats
which were probably playtested,
just not in every single combination with feats from past and future books.
Certain combinations of feats allowed for peasant-cannon level stupidity;
like killing a Tarrasque from full health.
Still the idea is solid and I am sad it is not in the game we play.
And so we get to the central rule of this article.

## No Feats

As written feats are implemented as follows:
when you level up and get an ASI,
you can forgo the ASI and pick an ability from the list instead.
Simple and clean[^1].
Still we would not be here if there was complete agreement
with the Big Reddish Book, so let me put down my arguments here.

As always, this is subjective.
You might not agree,
need not agree,
agree to disagree,
all that jazz.

My world though, my rules :)

### Feats are impersonal travesties which rarely reflect your actions

Have you ever been in this situation?
You talk with some folks,
IRL or online,
and someone mentions D&D in passing.
Then any random person pipes up
to espouse their _really cool paladin_ in this one campaign
who has THE BEST drip cloak
and killed a snake that one time
and has shoes that shine bright enough to blind enemies because the sun reflects off them
because he once took care of this shoe-shining kid
who got in deep with a cannibal cult that sold the human skins to leatherworkers
so this kid got framed for murder
but this paladin took their sword and
---SWISH! SLICE!---
split the police budget and also the police.

Sound familiar?
And the best part is that all of this stuff might have happened in any adventure,
homegrown or prefab.
No two adventuring parties will tackle a situation the exact same way
so the experience is pretty much guaranteed to be unique.
And if you get a unique item, like the Boots of Blinding the Police for your trouble?
Makes it all the sweeter.

Trinkets like the Boots of Blinding the Police are fun because they tell a story.
When you tell someone about your escapades,
the Boots show that you were there and did something remarkable.
It is kind of like you went to a music festival
and kept the entrance armlet for multiple years
until it rotted away around your wrist, and the smell---
but in exchange it lets you cast _flamethrower_ once every year at a student party.
In comparison a +1 sword just seems...bland.
Everyone has got one, it isn't special.

In my humble opinion modern feats suffer from a similar issue.
Older versions (and perhaps newer versions) do not have this problem
because feats were more like skill trees:
granular customization options
that give you access to more moves
or that improve moves that you already have.
Instead of a Fighter (Battlemaster)
you would build a fighter
and pick feats that give you access to one or more maneuvers each
and you might grab feats that (directly or circumstantially) power up those maneuvers.
Like you might grab
Trip Attack (attack knocks target prone),
Desperate Maneuver (spend hit dice to increase damage of maneuvers)
and Combat Pragmatist (reroll damage dice of 1-2 against prone targets).
...But instead what we actually get is prepackaged builds (ie. subclasses)
and a list of highly generic abilities with little justification _why_ they exist.

How is it you can suddenly pull off highly improbable actions pretty reliably?
Dunno man, guess I just got Lucky.

What did you put on those arrows?
They seem way more effective than they were last time we fought.

![I shrug and say "Discharge Keenly"]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/2023-10-29-no-feats-q2.svg)

Doesn't have the same effect, does it?
Make it a class ability or make it a reward for a training arc (like Diogo's cane).
That's how I think about it.
