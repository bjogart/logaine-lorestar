In the Good Old Days, fighters could only make one attack and all wizards had names like Xagyg (reverse it).
There was no such thing as a "feat".
And we liked it that way!

I do not intend to make this a history lesson, but I think context is key.
So here is what you need to know.
Feats were introduced in full in the Big Crunchy Revamped Edition.
That's a long time ago, and they were a different beast then.
If you skim the rule book, you find they are more like class abilities than "our" feats.

Here's an example using modern mechanics.
Say I make a new class called the, uh, "Battler."
The Battler gets a class entry, like the Fighter and Wizard.
But the Battler does _not_ get four pages of class abilities and subclasses.
Half a page will suffice (the rest is art).
Here's what's on that page:

- How big your hit dice are;
- How many attacks you make on your turn;
- You get to pick a feat every level.

That's 10% of the page; the rest of the text is the little class blurb about how _cool_ Battlers are.

That's it.
There is no more to the Battler.

But then you flip to the back of the book.
And lo and behold, right before the compendium of spells lies a compendium of feats:

<dl>
<dt>Power Attack (Barbarian, Battler)</dt>
<dd>When you attack, take a hit penalty equal to your proficiency to gain a damage bonus equal to twice your proficiency.</dd>

<dt>Nerd Rage (Barbarian)</dt>
<dd>During your rage you add your INT modifier to your damage rolls with weapon attacks.</dd>

<dt>Action Surge (Battler)</dt>
<dd>Once per rest you can take a second action on your turn.</dd>

<dt>Jumping Attack (Barbarian level 2, Battler level 2, Power Attack)</dt>
<dd>If you make a Power Attack after jumping at least 10', the damage is doubled.</dd>

<dt>Nerd Rave (Barbarian level 4, Power Attack, Nerd Rage)</dt>
<dd>Targets hit by your Power Attack during a rage must make a CON save or be stunned until the end of their next turn.</dd>

<dt>Action---Reaction (Battler level 4, Action Surge)</dt>
<dd>When you use your Action Surge, a creature of your choice within 30' refreshes their reaction.</dd>
</dl>

All together this means that when someone says "I play a Battler" that does not tell you all that much.
You'd need to talk about their character a lot more.
Consider these feats to be like Eldritch Invocations on steroids.
In the 5 of E, we _do_ have most of these abilities, but they come in a subclass package deal:
back then you played a "Battler with a support build" whereas nowadays we prefer "Battler (Strategist)".

Now I owe it to my taste in video games to say that I love this kind of gimmick.
It's like a skill tree that lets you make your character really _yours_.
And that is neat.
If you want to play a wizard with a background in the circus and acrobat training?
Take the feats that let you channel your spells into objects and throw spell-dagger mines.
If done well, feats can be super fun for both mechanical and roleplaying reasons.

None of this is limited to player characters, by the way.
Here's an example from our campaign: the elves of Kajuron.
quite a few of them grew up in a space where the laws of time were weird.
It makes sense that they adapted to live with that condition.
To represent that in-game, elves from Kajuron might have access to feats like these:

<dl>
<dt>Temporal Glitch (wood elf (Kajuron), level 3)</dt>
<dd>Once per day when you roll initiative you can swap your own initiative score with someone else's.</dd>

<dt>Temporal Irregularity (wood elf (Kajuron), level 7)</dt>
<dd>You can cast Blink once per day.</dd>
</dl>

Now these are just Kajuron; but you could do this for _everything_.

Now this system, as implemented, never was without issues.
Power creep, for one; and combining feats that were not designed to be put together could get...weird.
But dang it, it's such a cool concept!
The new playtest _might_ be a return to form, but the jury's still out on that one.
Our game certainly won't have feats, though, because 5E has Feats at Home.

## The Feats of Fifth Edition

To recap, feats were introduced in the edition that wanted to codify everything.
There are a two-hundred or so (in the PHB).
Your characters improve numerically on their own, but they rarely get extra abilities.
This is the role of feats: customize your character to fit your background and experiences.
To customize your character to be unique in a mechanical sense _in addition_ to a personal sense.

...see where I am going with this?
Do the _travesties_ in chapter 6 strike you as doing this?
Take Heavy Weapon Master, for example, touted as Cool and Good by all of <https://reddit.com/r/3d6>.
The most important boon it gives you is that you can convert your attacks into less accurate but more powerful strikes. 
In other words, having _surpassing skill with heavy weapons_ lets you turn "smash" into "SMASH".

What about one of the other famous feats, Lucky?
Well...you just get lucky.
That is it, that is literally all it does.
You might have a backstory worse than #$@! Batman, but are you ever unlucky?
No sirree!

This, for me, is the big issue.

Feats are not indicative of your character's past.

Feats are not indicative of your character's choices.

Feats are only indicative of _your_ choices.

I guess some might think that is an advantage.
"Well, I want to be a wizard that specializes in touch spells, but I am squishy, so I am taking Tough to tank hits."
But...really? _really?_
Somebody has to have coined some buzzword for that kind of logic already.
If not, how about "mechanical freedom"?
Me, though, I prefer a different descriptor.
One that starts with "ludo" and ends in "ance".

IMO if you want to be this melee wizard, try me.
Give me your best pitch, and if it is a workable one, we will make it happen.
And if a feat, class, or subclass is really not working out for you, talk to me.
I make 'em for lunch.
Just...not that mindless drivel from the book.
Unfortunately for you, I am a DM with _standards_.
