Those personal customized character sheets?
Download them here.

Just a precaution: my hard drive could break tomorrow at the exact same time the site host decides that serving PDFs is against the rules.
That means no more character sheets!
If you want guaranteed access to any of these files, download them, put them somewhere safe, and make a backup.

### Why multiple versions of one sheet?

Minutiae on my part.
The print versions have bigger resolution than your printer can handle.
It's way bigger than the digital version, which is lightweight so it opens quickly on your device of choice.

### How do I print my sheet?

On paper.

No, seriously.
The ones you got from me are 300-grams paper which is about as sturdy as paper gets.
Normal paper will do fine though.
As for size, these sheets are A5, so _technically_ you could fit 2 per A4 page.
However that also presumes your printer can handle 3 millimeter margins on all sides.
Mine can't---I tried.
The crop mark versions add a little space around the sheet, so those have to be printed 1 per A4.

This all assumes that you go through the print dialog and select "100%"/true size of course.

### This sheet looks different from the one I got.

It might!
The house style evolved naturally as I was forced to cram varying amounts of information on these sheets.
Every time I finished a new one, I've made a point to go back and make adjustments.
Of the top of my head:

- I miscounted the spell slots a bunch of times for Fridugar's sheet.
  Whoops.
- Eilanore's sheet looked a lot denser on the left side because all section headings were left-aligned.
  It looked better with them centered, so I went back and changed it for the other sheets too for consistency.
- I spotted a few keywords on Diogo's sheet that went unformatted.
  Rest assured that those perpetrators have been dealt with.
  <span style="font-variant-caps:small-caps">most firmly</span>.
- I originally removed the text elements from Diogo's design for just the inventory sheet so as not to interfere with the writing.
  After consideration I've given the info sheet the same treatment so the text stands out better.
- One of Fridugar's lists of things to do (TM) had the columns in a different order than all the others, so I swapped those.

### May I have some form-fillable sheets please?

No. 
Half the reason I began this project is because I want to see you scowl when I force you into a difficult decision and not the back of your laptop :P
That said, I have looked into it, and these days you can actually make form-fillable PDFs online.
It's a lot of fiddly mouse-work though---not exactly my style.
Feel free to make your own, though.

### Can you change <span style="text-decoration:underline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

A typo? 
Absolutely.

A mistake?
Without a doubt.

Can I remove this one column, swap those other two, and maybe add `insert-info-from-book-here`?

Ha, haha, hahahahahaha---
